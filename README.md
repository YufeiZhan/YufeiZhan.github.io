# About Me

Hi, I'm Yufei Zhan (Selina) from Shenzhen, China. I just graduated from my high school and am currently doing my CS bachelor's degree at the University of Edinburgh (2023).

I started to gain interst in Computer Science after I went to the High School Summer College offered by Stanford University at grade 10. Of course, it was my interest in Math first that led my exlploration in Computer Science. Even when I was quite young, I loved studying Math and solving math problems. (Yea, that's my cliché story 😊)

Personally, I love music to death. I learnt Guzheng at an early age and started to play the piano from the junior high school. Then, in my high school, I created a Chinese ensemble called Zhaohui, where Chinese instrument lovers develop passions and do projects together. We performed on Christmas and New Year concerts and regularly visited elderly houses to give out free performances. Other than traditional Chinese music, we do various types of music!

Now in my free time, I take online courses such as Algorithms and Machine Learning on Coursera and try to hone my programming skills by joining various coding competitions. I also join in HYPED and learn how C++ and Git work and am working on a CS project with my friend. In the weekends, I teach IELTS and get paid! I am so exciting cuz it's my first time earning money  myself!

I'm not super social but like making friends, so don't hesitate to reach out to me if you want to have a nerdy, musical friend!

(Just starting to make this website so there are still a lot to be updated soon...)
