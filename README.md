# About Me

Hi, I'm Yufei Zhan (Selina). I just graduated from the University of Edinburgh and I'm currently pursing my CS master in Duke University. I come from Shenzhen, China, originally a fishing village in the past.

I started to gain interst in CS after I went to the Stanford University's HSSC program at grade 10. I've always loved problem solving, which is inherently present in Math and CS. Therefore, they naturally beaome my favorite subjects. I started CS with coding in Java, expanding into software engineering, data science, machine learning, human-computer interaction later on during my undergraduate studies. While exploring all these subfields in CS, I decided to start a master to further deepen my interest.

In my free time, I'm passionate about education and sustainability in general. Thus I have been finding ways to use my academic strengths to resolve real-world issues under these two fields. I have been IGCSE CS tutor to high school students, IELTS speaking tutor to a college student, and tutor and demonstrator for two of my undergraduate courses (DMP and IADS). My final-year dissertation is about designing a course evaluation platform specifically for UoE School of Informatics. Otherwise, I was earning carbon iteracy certificate and have conducted research on vegetation reduction and urban expansion using data science.

Also, I love watching thriller, crime, detective series. Breaking Bad, Money Heist and Sherlock Holmes are the ones I recommend to everyone. I love cooking and I always cook myself, obsessing with any food that can be both healthy and delicious. I am a Guzheng player and have been in various ensembles.
