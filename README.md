## About Me

Hi, I'm Yufei Zhan (Selina) from Shenzhen, China. I just graduated from Shenzhen College of International Education and am currently doing my CS bachelor's degree at the University of Edinburgh.

I started to gain interst in Computer Science after I went to the High School Summer College offered by Stanford University at the summer after grade 10. Of course, it was my interest in Math first that led my exlploration in Computer Science. Even when I was quite young, I loved studying Math and solving math problems. (Yea, that's my clichÃ© story ðŸ˜Š)

Personally, I love music to death. I learnt Guzheng at an early age and started to play the piano from the junior high school. Then, in my high school, I created a Chinese ensemble called Zhaohui, where Chinese instrument lovers develop passions and do projects together. We performed on Christmas and New Year concerts and regularly visited elderly houses to give out free performances. Other than traditional Chinese music, we do various types of music!

I am not a sporty person but I do exercise a lot. I like playing badminton... before I sprained my left knee. I enjoy hiking and participated in the Duke of Edinburgh Award for 3 years and received Silver Certificate.
